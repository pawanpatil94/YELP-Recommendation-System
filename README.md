# SML-Yelp-Recommendation-System

Yelp is one of the most popular sites to find reviews of most of the business types in the US. Yelp has a huge database of reviews which form a critical source of information to learn about the respective businesses. Unfortunately, Yelp does not use these meaningful user reviews to its advantage to recommend restaurants or other business based on their preferences. Often, a review provides different perspectives of a business and personal experience accounts of users through which it is easier to learn about userâ€™s preferences. We focus on proposing a model to recommend restaurants to users by learning about their preferences from their reviews considering on 5 parameters: Food, Worthiness, Service, Ambience, Deals/Discount.
